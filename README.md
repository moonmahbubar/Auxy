 ## Getting Started
 
 ### Dependencies 
 
 1. ***Django*** for Python 3.7: You can install all the Django dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory.
 2. ***NPM with ReactJS***: First install ***node.js***. You can install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in `frontend/my-app`.
 
 ### Running Locally
 After you have the required dependencies, you can run app locally by doing the following:
 
 1. ***Start Django Server*** : Run `python3 manage.py runserver localhost:8000` in the root directory. This will initiate the Django backend server.
 2. ***Start the Frontend Server***L Run `npm start` in `frontend/my-app`. Then navigate to `localhost:3000` to use the app.
 
 ### Building
 
 To build the frontend, you can run `npm run build` in `frontend/my-app`.
